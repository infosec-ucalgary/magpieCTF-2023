## Description

Inbound Communication (Identity: HQ)...

Hello O-Team,

As you know, OmniFlags is back on their high horse and think they can claim the rest of humanity and the solar system for themselves. We, of course, will not let that happen. Our recon squads have found a file of theirs while snooping around and believe this can help stop them.

Good luck, \
HQ

Can you find out what this might be?

## Hint
Maybe they hid their plans in a site!

## Solution

1. Run a reverse image search on the image given 
2. Once you find the website with the image, the flag is hidden somewhere on the page
3. You should find the flag hidden in the footer of the site

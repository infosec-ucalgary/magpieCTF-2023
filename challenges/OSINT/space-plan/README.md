## Description
OmniFlag Corp is back at it again. It seems like they are planning something big and we have to stop them! I found a file of theirs leaked by someone named Rhonda Hooper while snooping around and maybe this could help stop them! 

Can you find out what this might be?

## Hint
Maybe they hid their plans in a site!

## Solution

1. Search up the name Rhonda Hooper into Twitter
2. Once you find the Twitter account, you be able to see some tweets posted. There, you'll find the image and the port number of the site you need to go to (http://srv1.2023.magpiectf.ca:26233/)
2. Once you find the website with the image, the flag is hidden somewhere on the page
3. You should find the flag hidden in the footer of the site

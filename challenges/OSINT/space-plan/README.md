## Description

Inbound Communication (Identity: HQ)...

Hello O-Team,

As you know, OmniFlags is back on their high horse and think they can claim the rest of humanity and the solar system for themselves. We, of course, will not let that happen. Our recon squads have found a file of theirs leaked by someone named Rhonda Hooper and believe this can help stop them.

Good luck, \

## Hint
Maybe they hid their plans in a site!

## Solution

1. Search up the name Rhonda Hooper into Twitter
2. Once you find the Twitter account, you be able to see some tweets posted. There, you'll find the image and the port number of the site you need to go to (http://srv1.2023.magpiectf.ca:26233/)
2. Once you find the website with the image, the flag is hidden somewhere on the page
3. You should find the flag hidden in the footer of the site

# No Password Here

## Description

Hello B-Team,

Here is one of the vaults that have a flag we need. There's a message associated with the vault, written as follows:

> Don't even think about trying the password because I do not know the password either. 
> I already informed my employees not to use "gets" when writing programs so what could possibly go wrong?

Good luck, \
HQ

## Hints
1. We know that gets is unsafe and I wonder if any other functions that are unsafe?

## Solution
1. Looking at the code we can see that there is a scanf reading the input.
2. We can use the scanf to cause a buffer overflow so it will overwrite the password with our input. Just spam a lot of 'a' into the input and you should be good.

## Flag

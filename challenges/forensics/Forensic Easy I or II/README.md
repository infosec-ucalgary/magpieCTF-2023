### Category: Forensic Easy

### Author: Ned Liu 

## Description

You know, space exploration is VERY VERY cool. You are see all kinds of cool things. Here is one of the photos we got. I can see something strange in the image is it a flag or am I too just too excited?

## Hints

1. The space is a little dark, can someone turn on the light? (I mean it literally, please do not over think it.)


## Solution

1. Turn on the brightness of the image and you will see the flag in the upper left corner

Flag: magpie{wh0_7u2n3d_0ff_7h3_119h7}

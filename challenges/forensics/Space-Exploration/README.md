## Description

You know, space exploration is VERY VERY cool. Here is one of the photos we got. There is something strange about the image but I cannot tell exactly what it is.

## Hints

1. The space is a little dark, can someone turn on the lights? (Don't over think it)


## Solution

1. Turn on the brightness of the image and you will see the flag in the upper left corner. This is an EASY challenge so DO NOT OVER THINK IT!

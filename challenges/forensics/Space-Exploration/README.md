### Author: Ned Liu 

## Description

You know, space exploration is VERY VERY cool. You are see all kinds of cool things. Here is one of the photos we got. I can see something strange in the image is it a flag or am I too just too excited?

## Hints

1. The space is a little dark, can someone turn on the lights? (don't over think it)


## Solution

1. Turn on the brightness of the image and you will see the flag in the upper left corner. This is an EASY challenge so DO NOT OVER THINK IT!

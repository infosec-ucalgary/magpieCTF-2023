## Introductory Letter

Hello Valued Employee!

Receiving this user manual solidifies your position as an OMNIFLAGS INC.
Communication Servicer. Your core responsibility will be ensuring communication
between the central communication server and the extra-terrestrial dataserver.
This user manual should provide necessary information for you to manage this
connection and ensure the efficient flag distribution our company provides. Your
work is integral to the future of our company, and we expect great results from
your job term. Any questions should be asked to your employer directly via
verbal communication.

## Enforcing the connection

As a Communication Servicer, your responsibility is to establish a connection
between the central communication server and the extra-terrestrial dataserver.
Your supervisor should have provided the appropriate IP address and port you
will need to configure your client program as necessary.

The following steps will describe the process to update your client's connection
to the central communication server.

1. Log-in to your OMNIFLAGS employee account
2. If you are initializing your workspace for the first time, click on
   "Configure". Otherwise, navigate to "Options > Network > Connection to
   Central Server > Reconfigure"
3. Within the "Host" input field, enter the IP address as provided by your
   employer
4. Within the "Port" input field, enter the port value as provided by your
   employer
5. Ensure your connection is properly established, start the client's built-in
   debug tool. This will open the debug terminal along with the list of commands
   to use.
6. Run a test command by entering "POSN" into the debug terminal. This should
   return with an appropriate output.
7. Confirm your changes by clicking "Confirm"

It will be important to report any system downtime immediately. Failure to
establish a connection without notifying your supervisor is inefficient and will
result in termination.

Connections should only be made to the server that your supervisor instructs you
to connect to. Unauthorized connections are considered mutiny and will result in
termination.

Connections must be made within a specific order. Satellites are typically
labelled such that connections should be made in a numerically or
lexicographically increasing order. For example, satellites labelled `[1, 2, 3,
4, 5]` must be connected such that satellite 1 projects information to satellite
2, satellite 2 projects information to satellite 3, 3 to 4 and 4 to 5. It may be
assumed that satellite 1 and satellite 5 already communicates to the central
communication server and the extra-terrestrial dataserver respectively.
Establishing this communication enables a bidirectional datastream between the
two servers. This allows all OMNIFLAGS employees to browse all shared files.

When pinging the positions of satellites, an arbitrary set of axis are defined
such that the y-axis points from the central communication server to the
extra-terrestrial dataserver. The scale of these axis are made arbitrary. Using
these axis, the satellites to connect will be displayed in 3D space within the
Graphical Satellite Display tab.

Satellites may be moved or reoriented to establish connections as necessary. The
Graphical Satellite Display provides necessary information to assist with this
process. Each point within the grid represents a satellite, each is labelled
with the symbol associated with it. Outward-pointing arrows show the orientation
of the satellite, and should be turned towards the next satellite to connect to
as necessary. Changes in position and orientation will be done with respect to
each set of axis. That is, calculations of positions or orientations are done
along with the arbitrarily defined set of axis. That is, for a given orientation
vector, the X-component of the satellites angular orientation is the angle
between the vector and the X-axis. Likewise, the X-component of the satellite's
position is the distance of the satellite from the YZ-plane along the X-axis.

The Satshell Client tool will ensure that calculations of any differences will
be determined correctly with respect to the Cartesian coordinate systems. Simply
adjust each knob within within the Control Panel tab, or enter specific values
within the input fields below each knob, to reorient the satellite as
necessary. Satellite orientations must point to the next satellite within five (5)
degrees of uncertainty. Exceeding orientations of five (5) degrees risk faulty
signals and the failure to establish a connection. The Graphical Display tab
will emulate changes as necessary in real-time to aid in making accurate
changes. These changes *do not* affect the Satellites in real-time. To perform
these changes, the "Execute" button must be clicked. This will inform the
Satshell Client to compile and send the necessary machine code to the central
communication server, which then communicates with each satellite as necessary.

5. Ensure position of satellites are as desired
6. Click "Execute" to compile and send necessary machine code

As mentioned, satellites may also be reoriented. The following instructions
explain this process.

##### Reorientation of Satellites
1. Refresh orientations to ensure validity of adjustments
2. Adjust "Angle-X" dial until the orientation vector is sufficiently angled
   from the X-axis
3. Adjust "Angle-Y" dial until the orientation vector is sufficiently angled
   from the Y-axis
4. Adjust "Angle-Z" dial until the orientation vector is sufficiently angled
   from the Z-axis
5. Ensure orientation of satellites are as desired
6. Click "Execute" to compile and send necessary machine code

Note: Satellite orientation must be within five (5) degrees of the expected
vector to ensure stable communication.

## Custom Architecture
As a core part of debugging, it is important to note that the satellites runs
off a custom, proprietary architecture. The following block diagrams of the
processor are simplified to contain the components necessary to complete each
task as necessary.

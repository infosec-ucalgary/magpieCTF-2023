   I may just be an intern, but the higher-ups show me no respect!!
   I'm the best cryptographer they could've possibly hired! After all I was
   the best in my class at transposing matrices in Linear Algebra I. Such
   a shame they never covered how it applied to cryptography...
   
   Anyways, I'll show them why I deserve more interesting tasks than just
   sorting folders and handing out coffees. Once they see how
   securely I've encrypted this important file I'm sure they'll
   assign me to something I deserve. Security through obscurity
   is always the way to go, and I doubt there's anyone who
   would ATTACK us that knows of this old man's cipher.
